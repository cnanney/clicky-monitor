		<dt>Goal Notification</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>You can be notified via HTML5 desktop notifications whenever a visitor completes a goal.</p>
			<p><a id="sample_notification" href="#" title="Behold HTML5 glory!">View example notification.</a></p>
			<p>When a goal is completed, it will display the following information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>List of goals the visitor has completed in this session</li>
				<li>Total value of goals completed</li>
				<li>Visitor's geolocation, as well as IP or custom username you have assigned</li>
				<li>Start time of visit</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When more than one visitor has completed a goal, you'll see an arrow in the title bar that you can click to scroll through the visitors.</p>
			<p>Notifications can be set to display for either 10, 20 or 30 seconds before disappearing. However, if you hover over a notification it will stay visible until you manually close it.</p>
			<p>The example notification above will not automatically expire, you have to manually close it.</p>
			<p>Goal checking and badge counters update every minute when actively using your browser.</p>
