        What do you want the counter on the ClickyChrome icon to keep track of? You can have it
        display the number of visitors currently online, the total number of visitors today, or the
        total number of goals completed today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Goal checking and badge updates adapt to your usage: every minute when active, reducing to
        every 2-10 minutes when idle, and pausing completely after 2 hours of inactivity to conserve
        API quota.
